    "For yeas, 2009, 2010, and 2012, there was a question of \"How often did you do this in the last 30 days?\" refering to \"In the last 30 days, did you drink so much that you exhibited signs of drunkenness, such as flushed face or reddened eyes, slurred or incoherent speech, unsteady or staggering gait, vomiting and hangover in the next day?\". This question was dropped so that the DF could be concat, as there's another quesion that is the same but reffers to \"In the last 30 days, did you drink at least 5 glasses or cans of alcohol on one occasion?\". This is because having more than one column with the same name creates umbiguity. It was only for some of the years and there were other questions that helped provide similar information (including the one kept) that it seemd reasonable to drop it."
